## For the services provided by Hypatia Learning AS

We provide services that gives all organisations the possibility to govern all data produced by systems that require a user to logon to get access.

### The school and educational use case

In education users use their login identity (in Norway FEIDE) to get access to digital services and digital resources provided by a pletora of providers. In todays environment all data produced by the learners in interacting with the services and resources is managed and controlled by the provider.

This is problematic of a number of reasons.

1. Data produced by children need extra protection
2. Children cannot give consent to use and governance of data
3. It almost impossible for the educational institution to process the data for greater insight about the progression of the learners.

However, when the educational institution governs the data, there are several benefits:

1. Educational instituion decides how data is to be processed
2. One singel entity for parents to give consent to use of childrens data
3. Data could be used to provide value for educators, learners, educational institution, parents
4. Educational institution could govern data and provide services for the learners throughout their learning carrier at the educational institution - in a longevity perspectiv.
5. For the learners theiy will have all their data governed by one entity, and transferring the data to other services will then be much easier to manage.
